          <p>Preview and Final Versions are hosted in Amazon AWS Static Servers - configured to hold the most demanin loads.</p>

        <h2>Where has CLAY been used?</h2>

        <p>CLAY has been used in over 10 Interactives developed for Fusion.net each of them receiving peak loads of over 300 Thousand Visitors per Hour.</p>

        <p>CLAY is also integral part of the Clearbit for Saleforce Integration - a Visualforce Widget that's embedded into </p>

        <p>CLAY is also the integral part of our Salesforce ERP System, Goal Managment and Automated Marketing. Consisting in over 30 Apps that transct over $14 Million Dollars. </p>

        <p>CLAY is used in over 100 Personal and Commercial Apps developed by our team and partners.</p>

        <h2>What is CLAY for Salesforce.com</h2>
        <p>Clay for Salesforce is an extension to build Web and Mobile Apps that run inside Salesforce and Salesforce1. It's used to build businesss Apps.</p>

        <p>CLAY features a Development Server that redefines how visualforce is coded and makes it 10X Faster. It also automates deployment of Visualforce Pages and Static Resources which represent another huge performance driver.</p>

        <p>With CLAY developers can build Javascript Apps traditionaly using Salesforce Data via Visualforce Pages and Visualforce Remoting.</p>

        <h2>Why should I use CLAY?</h2>
        <p>If your startup or department has an automated workflow for building front end apps, and runs the infrastructure in a first level cloud - where every project follows a standard workflow and Apps can be deployed and updated any second by pressing a button - then you don't need CLAY.</p>

        <p>Otherwise - you either need to develop CLAY yourself or you can jump in and start using CLAY right now.</p>

        <p>On the other hand if you are ok by not having an automated frontend development workflow that publishes to static cloud servers - getting starting with CLAY today is smart. Your operation will probably get more complicated and you'll need CLAY soon. </p>

        <h1 class="noticable" data-section="receipts">Clay Receipts</h1>

        <p >3VOT provide several receipts which are pre-configured development environments.</p>

        <p data-id="4" class="content-block">There is nothing special about them and you can personalize them or build your own if you are an advanced developer - instructions down the fold.</p>

        <p>Start by downloading or cloning them from Github.</p>

          <h2 >Setup of Receipts</h2>
          
          <p>Once you have downloaded/cloned a receipt - go to Terminal or CMD in Windows and navigate to your project root folder.</p>

          <p>From this root folder - you'll create, develop and publish apps.</p>

          <h3  >Install Dependencies</h2>
  
          <p data-id="5" class="content-block">CLAY Receipts uses NPM Dependencies - which is great for frontend projects. Download and Installation is automated by NPM ( Node Package Manager )</p>

          <p>Required dependencies are kept in Package.json - you can search over 100K in <a href="npmjs.org">npmjs.org</a></p>

          <h3>.ENV</h2>

          <p data-id="6" class="content-block" >Clay projects require a .env file on the root folder of the project. </p>

          <p>Make sure you create a .env file that looks like this. This file contains secret keys, make sure is mentioned in .gitignore file so it's not uploaded to your repository.</p>

    
          <h2>Folder Structure</h2>
          <p>Follows Convention over Configuration.</p>
          <ul  data-id="6.5" class="content-block folders">
            <li>-src
                <li><span class="folder">-- css</span> <span>style files, inlines imports and adds vendor-prefixes</span></li>
                <li><span class="folder">-- htdocs</span> <span>html, fonts and static files </span></li>
                <li><span class="folder">-- images</span> <span>images</span></li>

            </li>
          </ul>

          <p  >The following folders don't need to be modified</p>

          <ul class="folders">
            <li><span class="folder">- build</span> <span>auto-generated for local server</span></li>

          <h2>Salesforce Receipts</h2>
          
          <p data-id="7" class="content-block" >Clay4Salesforce Receipts are a very similar to Open Web Receipts - they share folder structure and Gulp Automation Tasks.</p>

          <p>The difference between Salesforce Receipts lies in the fact the we don't use HTML pages - but instead we use Visualforce Pages. The File src/htdocs/index.html is actually a Visualforce Page</p>

          <p>When SF Receipts run in Development Mode ( explained in The CLI Section ) , files like CSS, JS and Images point to the local files. When SF Receipts are published to Salesforce they point to Static Resources.</p>

          <p>In order for this to work you must use the {{3vot}} tag before each file, look at the example on the right. {{3VOT}} tags get's replaced for http://localhost:3000/xxxxxx in Development and StaticResource Tag.in Production</p>

          <p>Feel free to use any Visualforce Tags. You can use a HEAD tag - but don't use a BODY tag - since it's not supported by Visualforce</p>

        <h3>Salesforce .env File</h3>
        <p data-id="8" class="content-block" >The .env file when used with Salesforce Receipts must also include the Admin Username, Password and Security Token.</p>

        <p>This credentials are used to manage Visualforce Pages and Static Resources, make sure .env files are keeped in the .gitignore file so they are not committed to your repo.</p>
